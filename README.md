# Choke-tester

# This choke tester i built is from one of my older magazine called "Amatérské Rádio", it´s full of usefull knowledge and nice schematics like this.

# It nicely show where the so called "overshoot point" is (bod přesycení), if you have an osciloskope with 2 chanels you can nicely show the 2 characteristics.

# The first is square wave that creates 555 timer circuit, if we utilize lower frequency we wont be able to properly test the overshoot point, but if we will slowly rise this frequency we will see the rising satiating current to the coil, at some point the current must stop rising (due to the overshoot point), and we will see at wich frequency it is, so we will now know at wich point is our maximum frequency of the coil and we will not unnecesary supply current.

# Schematic of the project is available to all of you (as well as the rest of the zip file), and if you want you can create your own better schematic.

# All necessary part you will find in the eagle file.

# Thank you.
